Random variables

Conditional Probability as a Random Variable

Independent Events

Zero Probability Events:
    $$P(E) == 0$$ 
    Not the same as impossible events.
    These are relevant when dealing with uncountable sets where every outcome by itself has 0 probability and even some events have 0 probability but are not impossible. For example consider the sample space to be the interval [0,1] and then consider the event that the outcome of our experiment is a rational number. Since the rationals are countable because they can be written as a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="Can be mapped from the naturals">sequence</a>.
